# CRM(Customer Relationship Management) Service API

---

- This main feature of the CRM application is to resolve the user complaints(issue raised by the user through the ticket creation).

### Features

---

- User SignUp(Registration) and SignIn Functionality
- Admin registration will be from the backend directly.(For testing purpose, doing it, from the veryFirst time server started) Though, the ADMIN user creation request are taken and send it with response as BAD REQUEST status.
- Engineer registration will be supported through API, but it needs to be approved by the ADMIN to signIn successfully into the system.
- Customer registration will be supported through API with no approval needed from the ADMIN.
- API to support the ADMIN/CUSTOMER/ENGINEER signIn. SignIn will be successfull in case of users with APPROVED userStatus . Successfull SignIn API call should return the access token, which will be used by the concerned user to make all the other calls on the protected endpoints.
- On ticket creation by the user, an engineer (with approved status) will be auto assigned the ticket who has minimum number of tickets assigned to him. In case,by any chance , no approved engineer is available during ticket creation,the message will be displayed that "No enginner available ,all engineers are on strike, kindly check after some time !".And we are sending the mail notification, to the admin also for every ticket creation, so immediately admin can have a look and assing an engineer by approving a engineer.
- On ticket creation and updation, a email will be send automatically to all the concerned users of those tickets .This has been done with the help of another notificationService API, which has been integrated with this CRM.
- Tickets and users can be queried based on various optional query Parameters.Only the concerned user will get the results of those that they are authorised for.
- ADMIN has all the rights.
- Customer has the rights related to ticket created by own.
- Engineer has the rights with the tickets created or tickets assigned.
- On sucessfull updation of ticketStatus, repsective engineeraffected property will also be updated internally.
- Only the ADMIN can change the assignee of the ticket.
- There is one restriction on the ADMIN too, admin can't change the  assingee and ticketStatus at same time, as it may result inconsitency over the data.

### Code organisation in the repository-

---

The whole code base is arranged in multiple directories and files.
Project follows Models, Controllers, Routes (MCR Architecture Pattern), to arrange the code.

1. Models directory contain files dealing with the defining the database Schemas.
2. Controllers directory contain files dealing with handling the core business logic.
3. Routes directory contain the files managing with the routes.
4. Middlewares directory to define all middlewares(generally related for validating incoming requests).
5. Utils directory contains the files that have reusable code(functions).
6. Configs directory for all configs file to configure all the configurations realted to server,database and authentication.
7. The main startup file is "index.js".

### Tech

---

CRM Service API, uses a number of open source projects (all are npm packages) to work properly:

- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)- Express is a web framework for node. Using it to create a server and managing dofferent routes.
- [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) - For hashing the secret credentials of the user and verifying them.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env
- [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) -For creating access token and verifying them.
- [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) - Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- [node-rest-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rest-client) - Allows connecting to any API REST and get results as js Object. In our case, using it to connect to notificationService API.
- this app requires Node.js(Runtime Environment) v16+ and mongodb v5+(Database, for persistance of data) to run.

#### Install the dependencies and devDependencies by following instructions.

```sh
cd CRM

##### Before running the app locally, ensure to put all the configurable properties in .env file(following seperation of concern design principle).

##### IMPORTANT NOTE-This App integrated with a notification service app, to send email notification asynchronously to the concerned members of the ticket on ticket creation and updation.
